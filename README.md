# Atomic Lyrics

A minimalist personal blog built with [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Deploy the static build to GitHub Pages for quick hosting.

## Local development

1. Install Node.js (16+ recommended).
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev` and open the URL shown in the terminal.
4. Run tests with `npm test`.

## Build & Deploy

To generate static files run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist` folder. Push the repository to GitHub and configure GitHub Pages to serve the contents of `dist`.
